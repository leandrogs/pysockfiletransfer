pysockfiletransfer
==================

Small project designed to transfer files using sockets in Python

User can download files from server, see list of files on server, send file to the server after authenticate herself. Passwords are encrypted but they are recorded at a txt file.

This project is only to give a introduction to sockets in Python, so I didn't take care of advanced subjects such as seccurity and advanced python functions.

I'll take a closer look in any suggestion to make this code better.
